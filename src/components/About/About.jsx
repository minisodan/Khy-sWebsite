        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p2>
          Born in Texas, but raised in Louisiana and now currently attending
          MNSU for an Art Degree, Khy has been doing photography for only a year
          now. In May 2021, He bought his first DSLR Camera [Sony A7iii] and
          consistently uploads his photos on this website or his Instagram
          account [@khyron.iii] Khy has an eye for capturing real "In the
          moment" pictures and strives to make the viewer feel like they are
          actually there in the photo. He mainly does street photography, but
          really will shoot anything on his camera from nature to architecture
          to even studio photographs.
